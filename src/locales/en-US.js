        Each information interface can display up to four

        either: text, an image, a video, or some audio.
      </p>

        You can use markdown style syntax to add formatting to your text. Supported formatting
        includes headings, bold, italic, and external links.

      <p>
        Here, you can determine the type of node that this name generator will work with. Either
        choose from your existing node types, or create a new one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of the node&apos;s &quot;type&quot; as its most fundamental attribute. To ascertain
        what it may be, ask yourself what the node represents. For example, is it a person? A place?
      </p>
      <p>
        Node types are fundamental to the way that Network Canvas works. A node&apos;s type
        determines it&apos;s visual properties, as well as the variables available to assign on
        other interfaces.

      <h4>Name</h4>
      <p>
        Name your variable meaningfully, and in a way you will remember and recognise.
        Variable names are used when exporting interview data, so it is a good idea to
        create a consistent pattern or system for your naming.
      </p>
      <h4>Description</h4>
      <p>
        Use the description field to add any additional information you may need to help you
        recognise this variable later. You may wish to use this field to include notes about
        the purpose of the variable, its origin in theoretical literature, or other information
        or relevance.
      </p>
      <h4>Type</h4>
      <p>
        The variable type determines how and where you can use it within your interview, as
        well as the characteristics of the data it will collect. Because of this, you should
        be certain that the variable type you choose here is correct. It is not easily possible
        to change the type of a variable after it has been created.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Text</strong> - Used for storing text in a variable.</li>
        <li><strong>Number</strong> - Used for storing numerical values.</li>
        <li><strong>DateTime</strong> - Used for storing date or time data.</li>
        <li><strong>Boolean</strong> - Used for true or false (dichotomous) values.</li>
        <li><strong>Ordinal</strong> - An ordered categorical list of options.</li>
        <li><strong>Categorical</strong> - An unordered list of options</li>
        <li><strong>Layout</strong> - A special variable used to store sociogram layout data.</li>
        <li><strong>Location</strong> - Used for storing geospatial (Lat/Long) data.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Validation</h4>
      <p>
        The validation section allows you to define constraints on your variable that must be
        fulfilled. These constraints will depend on the type of variable you are editing. For
        example, a categorical variable will let you limit the minimum and maximim number of
        options that must be selected, whereas a text variable will let you set the minimum and
        maximum length.
